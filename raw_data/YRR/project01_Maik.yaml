description: 
  - We are trying to build a synthetic sensor for mechanical stress in bacteria, so that we can modulate a hydrogel in which they are embedded by the secretion of proteins upon stress induction.
  - I am investigating synthetic sensors.
  - The synthetic sensors should sense mechanical stress.
  - The synthetic sensors are designed for bacteria.
  - he bacteria are embedded in a hydrogel.
  - he hydrogel can be modulated by proteins.
  - he proteins are secreted by the bacteria.
  - he secretion happens upon mechanical stress.
