description: 
  - I am investigating how to improves cell-cell interaction in mammalian multicellular cell aggregates by tailored cell-surface bound polymeres generated by ATRP. 
  - I am investigating how to improve cell-cell interaction.
  - Cell-cell interaction have to be improved in mammalian multicellular cell aggregates.
  - Cell-cell interaction can be improved by cell-surface bound synthetic polymeres.
  - Synthetic polymeres are generated by ATRP.
