  What are you investigating?
  We investigate how we can control the metabolic activity and cell growth by changing the mechanical properties of the surrounding matrix using ultrasound
  
  
description_tuples:
  - We, investigate, cell growth
  - The cell growth, is corrleated, to the metabolic activity
  - Metabolic activity, is related, to the mechanical properties of the surronding matrix
