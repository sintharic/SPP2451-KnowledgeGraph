description: 
  - we are investigating the entrapment of plant-growth-promoting bacteria in microgels for seed coatings

description_tuples:
  - we are investigating the entraptment
  - plant growth-promoting bacteria are entrapped in microgels
  - microgels coat seeds


performance_metrics_tuples:

  - bacteria, produce, metabolites 
  - metabolites, promote, plant growth

measurement_description_tuples:
  - Microgel size measured with optical microscopy
  - Images are analysed with Image J
  - bacteria are stained with SYTO 9 and Propidium iodide
  - stained bacteria are viewed via confocal microscopy 
  - we take photos and Z-Stacks
  - the photos are analysed with image J
  - the confocal microscope is a Leica TCS SP8

methods:
