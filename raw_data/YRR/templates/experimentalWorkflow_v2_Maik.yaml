- Growth conditions
- strain background
- light source (e.g. when using FACS, microscope etc) -> it might be important to only give specifications of the machine, but also from the used parts (lens, laser etc)... this could be an extension of the instrument part
- to an experimental workflow, there is usually more than one machine involved (incubator, FACS/paltereader)
